# Spotify-API-Binding
Can set keybindings to control spotify from my keyboard so I don't have to keep alt tabbing

I get annoyed by having to alt tab out of whatever Im doing just to skip my music, or like or do whatever I feel like on spotify, so I made this so I can set keybindings on my keyboard so I no longer have to alt tab.

# How to create an executable
make sure you have installed pyinstaller
then run
```cmd
pyinstaller --onefile skip.py
```
